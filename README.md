## Data Processing Project

### Overview

The Data Processing Project is a project that focuses on the processing of large datasets to extract meaningful information from them. The project involves using various tools and techniques to transform raw data into a format that is suitable for analysis.

The project has been broken down into the following steps:

Data Collection

Data Cleaning

Data Transformation


### Data Collection

The first step in the data processing project is data collection. This involves gathering the data that will be used for analysis. The data came from kaggle source

### Data Cleaning

Once the data has been collected, the next step is data cleaning. Data cleaning involved removing any irrelevant or duplicate data, and fixing any errors or inconsistencies in the data.

This  involved:

Removing missing or null values

Removing duplicates

Fixing spelling errors

Data Imputation

Data cleaning is an important step because it ensures that the data is accurate and consistent.

### Data Transformation

After the data has been cleaned, the next step is data transformation. This involves transforming the data into a format that is suitable for analysis. This involve:

Aggregating data

Joining data

Grouping data

Filtering data

Encoding data 

Data transformation is an important step because it helps to simplify the data and make it easier to analyze.



### Conclusion

The Data Processing Project is an important project that involves using various tools and techniques to process large datasets and extract meaningful insights from them. The project involves several steps, including data collection, data cleaning, data transformation,and data analysis. By following these steps, it is possible to turn raw data into actionable insights that can be used to make informed decisions.
